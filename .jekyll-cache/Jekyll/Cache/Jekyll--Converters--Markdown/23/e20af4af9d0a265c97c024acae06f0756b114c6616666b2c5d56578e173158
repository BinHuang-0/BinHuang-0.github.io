I"g<p>Hello World! This is me figuring out how github pages works in conjunction with Jekyll. This website should serve as a sort of development diary for me as well as a place to put down my thoughts, which, I guess, is an actual diary.</p>

<p>As an introductory post, I guess I donâ€™t really know what to put down here, but I hope to post many updates and keep an up to date record of my goings on.</p>

<p>Also check out my social medias. My <a href="https://github.com/BinHuang-0">GitHub repos</a> for info about my projects, and my <a href="https://twitter.com/bhuang3">Twitter</a> for my random thoughts.</p>
