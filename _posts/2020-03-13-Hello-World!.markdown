Hello World! This is me figuring out how github pages works in conjunction with Jekyll. This website should serve as a sort of development diary for me as well as a place to put down my thoughts, which, I guess, is an actual diary.

As an introductory post, I guess I don't really know what to put down here, but I hope to post many updates and keep an up to date record of my goings on.

Also check out my social medias. My [GitHub repos][github] for info about my projects, and my [Twitter][twitAccount] for my random thoughts.
